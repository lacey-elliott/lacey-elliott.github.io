	<p>Iâ€™m an avid festival goer and I love glitter! However, once I realized I was covering myself and the world in little bits of plastic it took the sparkle out of it for me. I am on a mission to bring eco glitters into the mainstream and let everyone know you can still be fabulous without hurting the environment.</p>

		<li>Biodegradable glitters and glitter blends</li>
		<li>Face Jewels and other accessories to complete your look</li>
		<li>Custom glitter blends - Perfect for wedding favors, bachelorette parties or just because :)</li>
